== Data Model ==

Bottlenose is about Courses and the Users who take or teach
them.

A Course is made up of several Chapters, each of which contains
several Lessons and one Assignment. Each Lesson consists of a Video, a
Question, and a second Video to be watched after the Question.

Users who take Courses will navigate to the Lesson web page, watch the
first Video, submit an Answer to the Question, and then optionally
watch the second Video. At the end of the Chapter, they can download
an Assignment, complete it and submit their answer as a Submission.

Users who teach Courses have administrative control over Chapters,
Lessons, Assignments, Videos, and Questions. They also have access to
student Answers and Submissions, as well as to reports summarizing
student performance.

Some users are site administrators who have administrative control
over Courses and which Users are teaching them.
